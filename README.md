## Extended Annotations of DeepFashion Images for Fine-grained Recognition

- Each folder contains the train, test and dev (validation) sets of images for a category of clothes from Deepfashion dataset.

- Vocab.txt for each category contains the list of attributes for that category.

- The links to images in train, dev and test txt files are the links to the Img subfolders in the original [DeepFashion dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pWGplNFhjc01NbzQ).
